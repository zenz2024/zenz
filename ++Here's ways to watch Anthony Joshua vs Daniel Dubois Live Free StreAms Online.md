## How did Joshua and Dubois land this fight?
Thirty-one fights into his career, Joshua has made the journey from Olympic Games wonderkid to heavyweight champion of the world twice before.

Defeat to Oleksandr Usyk by unanimous decision in 2021 however handed him a second career loss, and his third came in a rematch in 2022.

That could have spelled the end of Joshua's tenure at the top of the division, but he has fought his way back into contention over the past two years with four further victories.

Wins over Jermaine Franklin, Robert Helenius, Otto Wallin and Francis Ngannou have rebuilt his reputation, and positioned him once again as a challenger for Dubois and his title.

Younger by almost eight years, Dubois might not possess the pedigree that his opponent does, but has earned his reputation as one of the top heavyweights in the business.

His wins over Trevor Bryan and Kevin Lerena in 2022 saw him earn and then defend the WBA (Regular) heavyweight title.

He too lost to the unified champion Usyk, but wins against Jarrell Miller and Filip Hrgovic restored him to mandatory challenger status, and now IBF champion after Usyk relinquished the belt for a Tyson Fury rematch.
