# zenz
Passionate about Zen-Z, a philosophy of mindfulness and simplicity. I strive to bring balance and clarity to my work by focusing on thoughtful, purposeful code. Whether in development or design, my goal is to create solutions that are both efficient and harmonious, embracing the principles of Zen to navigate challenges with calm and precision.
